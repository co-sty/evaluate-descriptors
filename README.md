# Evaluation of keypoint descriptors

Implementation of Jared Heinly's criteria, from [*Comparative Evaluation of Binary Features*](//www.cs.unc.edu/~jheinly/publications/eccv2012-heinly.pdf) (Jared Heinly, Enrique Dunn, Jan-Michael Frahm). The aim is to evaluate the performance of **binary descriptors** of keypoints.

## Criteria

- putative match ratio
- precision
- matching score
- recall
- entropy
